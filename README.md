# Chatbot-With-Big-Five-Traits aka Personality-Based Conversational AI Using GPT-4 and LangChain


This project aims to build a personality-aware conversational AI using OpenAI's GPT-4 model and the LangChain library. The AI dynamically adjusts its responses based on the user's personality, assessed using the Big Five personality traits model: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The project leverages GPT-4 for natural language processing with few shot prompting techniques, while LangChain facilitates the integration of memory, conversation history, and chainable operations to enhance the interaction flow.
The primary goal is to create a chatbot that not only responds to user queries but also adapts its tone, style, and advice based on the ongoing analysis of the user's personality, resulting in more tailored and meaningful interactions.
