        "            Openness to Experience (Openness): This trait reflects the degree to which a person is imaginative, curious, and open to new experiences. High openness indicates a preference for novelty, creativity, and intellectual exploration, while low openness suggests a more conventional and straightforward approach to life.\n",
        "\n",
        "            Conscientiousness: This trait measures the degree to which a person is organized, responsible, and dependable. High conscientiousness is associated with careful planning, self-discipline, and reliability. Low conscientiousness tends to indicate a more spontaneous or disorganized lifestyle.\n",
        "\n",
        "            Extraversion: This trait reflects the extent to which a person is outgoing, talkative, and energized by social interactions. High extraversion is linked with sociability, assertiveness, and a tendency to seek excitement, while low extraversion (introversion) is characterized by being more reserved, thoughtful, and preferring solitary activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "            Agreeableness: This trait measures how cooperative, compassionate, and empathetic a person is. High agreeableness indicates a friendly, altruistic, and harmonious approach to relationships, while low agreeableness suggests a more competitive, critical, or antagonistic disposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "            Neuroticism: This trait reflects emotional stability and the degree to which a person experiences negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, or irritability. High neuroticism indicates emotional instability and frequent mood swings, while low neuroticism suggests calmness, emotional resilience, and a positive outlook.\n",
